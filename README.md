# Smart_calc

Teaching team project. Implemented in a team of two people.
Team: [teammate: Mikhail Kukhtachev](https://github.com/Kuhtaaa).

In this project, an extended version of a conventional calculator is implemented in the C++ programming language in the object-oriented programming paradigm. In addition to basic arithmetic operations, like plus-minus and multiply-divide, it is possible to calculate arithmetic expressions taking into account priorities, as well as some mathematical functions (sine, cosine, logarithm, etc.). In addition to evaluating expressions, the calculator also supports the use of the variable x and plotting the corresponding function. As additional improvements, there is a loan and deposit calculator.

## Pattern was used:

- MVC

## Stack: 

C++, STL, QT6/Creator, QCustomPlot lib.
